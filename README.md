# GARBO
In clinical applications, feature selection is a crucial step for the selection of low dimensional biomarkers from high 
dimensional data generated by Omics technologies. Here we introduce GARBO, a novel multi-siland adaptive genetic algorithm to 
simultaneously optimize accuracy and set size in omics-driven biomarker discovery problems. 

The GARBO algorithm is currentely implemented in python.

## Installation

Install phython 2.7 and install  the following python modules within your virtual environment
sklearn, multiprocessing, matplotlib, operator, bisect, deap, numpy, random, skfuzzy, cPickle, pandas, scipy, sys, getopt
source activate 'your_virtual_env'

## Examples

To run GARBO in parallel on a computer desktop

```sh
export NGEN=100 # Indicate the number of GA-iterationsexport 
NPOP=50 # Indicate the number of the chromosomes to be generated for each nicheexport 
MINL=30 # Indicate the initial minimum length of the generated chromosomesexport 
MAXL=50 # Indicate the initial maixmum length of the generated chromosomesexport 
NN=2 # Specify the number of nichesexport 
RN=1 # Indicate if an initial rank of the features must be compiled (RN=1) otherwise it starts with no ranking information (RN=0).
export INPUT_FILE="data_ccle_erl_ge.csv" # Omics dataset (samples as columns and rows as features< The last feature must named 'class' and it correpsonds to the target label)
export OUTPUT_DIR="MRNA_run_1"    # Folder that will contain a file for each nicheserialized python-obejcts. Each file contains the
mkdir $OUTPUT_DIR
nohup python runGARBO.py -g $NGEN -p $NPOP -s $MINL -l $MAXL -n $NN -r $RN -i $INPUT_FILE -o $OUTPUT_DIR > output_mrna.log &
